Hexagonal Lock Screen ![Alt text](https://github.com/DollarAkshay/Hexagonal-Lock-Screen/blob/master/Screenshots/Icon.png =50x50)
=====================

Created this beautiful lock screen at the HashCode Hackathon 2014 conducted at PESIT college on 8th and 9th of November 2014.
It was a 24 hour hackathon full of excitement and inovative engineers hacking their way to glory.

#### Can be rendered without the black border.Somewhat makes it look more suitable for Windows 8 theme when borders are disabled
